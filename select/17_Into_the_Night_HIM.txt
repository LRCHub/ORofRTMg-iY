Trapped in autumn, buried beneath the leaves
To the echo of the summer softly weeping
Sinking further in this seminary sea
Painting pain with pastels through her cemetery eyes
Into the night we ride, scars wide open
Into the night, you and I torn and broken
Bleed into the night
Blinded by the sun's brightest rays
Lading you two from the sharpened razor blades
Side by side; darkness and light
Play their game so unafraid, their hearts in synchronized
Into the night we ride, scars wide open
Into the night, you and I torn and broken
Bleed into the night and I'll meet you there
Waiting for the world to end
Oh let it end again
Into the night we ride, scars wide open
Into the night, you and I torn and broken
Bleed into the night, arms wide open
