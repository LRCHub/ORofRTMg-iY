The sunrise has no colour
Compared to your eyes
Shining into mine
When i'm with you
There can be no other
Just you and me
Thats how it should be...

Into the night
Into the dream
Into the way you turn me round
The world, can wait
Into the day
Into the light
Into the fires with my problems when im with you
Im into the night

Your fingers trembling and fumbling
With all the love you have
Wrapped around my shoulders
I smile as i cry
I brush the hair from your eyes
Is there some imaginary light
That we cross...

Into the night
Into the dream
Into the way you turn me round
The world, can wait
Into the day
Into the light
Into the fires with my problems when im with you
Im into the night

You kissed the tears from my face
I heard you whisper my name
You whispered my name
I beg you when the day light comes
Don't drift away...

The sunrise has no colour
Compared to your eyes
Shining into mine
When i'm with you
There can be no other
Just you and me
Thats how it should be
Just you and me

Oh baby into the night...
Into the night...
Into the night...
Into the n-i-i-i-ght...

Into the night
Into the dream
Into the way you turn me round
The world, can wait
Into the day
Into the light
Into the fires with my problems when im with you
Im into the night
