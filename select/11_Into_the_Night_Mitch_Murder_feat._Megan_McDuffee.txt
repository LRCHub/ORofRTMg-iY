Just breathe in deep,
And taste the air.

Just take my hand,
Lead anywhere.
I'll follow you there.

Dive into the warm and beating night
Let's go.
No cares, just driving on our own.

Into the pulsing city light,
We'd go.
With me you'll never be alone.

Remembering
Old summer dreams.

When all the world
Was as it seemed.
Only you and me.

Only you and me.

Embrace your fear
So come what may,
You and I will
Live for today.

Dive into the night.
