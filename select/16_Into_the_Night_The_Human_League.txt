Do you turn left
Do you turn right
Back to your bed
Or into the night

Wake me shake me just let me know
Take me make me hungry to go
Oh you defiant ones
You startled simians
Where would you go
If you were free

Our futures waiting there
The futures everywhere
Beyond the door if you could see

Do you turn left
Do you turn right
Back to your bed
Or into the night

Do you walk on
Do you stay back
Do you defend or do you attack

Wake me shake me just let me know
Take me make me hungry to go
Darling bohemians
With less chameleons
Too chic to dare to disagree

Empty rebellions
From charming helions
Delicious fate, your guarantee

Do you turn left
Do you turn right
Back to your bed
Or into the night

Wake me shake me just let me know
Take me make me hungry to go
Do you walk on
Do you stay back
Do you defend or do you attack
