Into the eye of the storm
deception and scorn
dark clouds taking form
Into the depths of the sea
I can not breathe
I'm lulled into sleep
I'm sinking deeper in a bottomless sea
Into the night, the waves grow higher
Into the night, where foes conspire
Here where all daylight gives in
Into the night, so cold and dire
Into the night, the moon rise higher
Here at the end of all things
Into the lingering dark
No light in my heart
no gleam, nor a spark
Into the realms of the moon
a bright silver spoon
a dying maroon
The undertaker emerged way too soon
Les vagues se déchaînent
